# CLAUDE.md - Vicu Android and iOS

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working on the Vicu mobile app (Android and iOS).

## Project Overview

**Vicu** for Android and iOS - a task manager powered by [Vikunja](https://vikunja.io/) as the backend. Kotlin, Compose Multiplatform UI and Material 3, one codebase for both platforms: the screens, view models, sync engine and data layer are shared, and each platform adds its own pieces (see "iOS" below and `docs/ios.md`). It is the mobile companion to the Vicu desktop app (Electron + React + TypeScript) and the two apps ship together (2.1.0 here and desktop 2.0.1 at the time of writing). Both talk to the same Vikunja server and must interpret synced data the same way (see "Cross-app contract").

**Design inspiration**: Things 3. Clean, minimal UI with generous whitespace, collapsible sections, circular animated checkboxes, and a prominent FAB (+) for quick task entry.

### Reference
The desktop app is at `C:\Users\rendy\vscode\vicu`. Consult its source when you need implementation details not covered here. The shared documents (`docs/cross-app-semantics-v1.md`, `docs/description-format-v1.md`) and the fixtures in `test-fixtures/` are kept identical in both repos.

## Commands

```bash
./gradlew test                  # All JVM unit tests: :app and :shared (commonTest + androidHostTest)
./gradlew lint                  # Android lint (see the note below)
./gradlew assembleDebug         # Debug APK (applicationId com.rendyhd.vicu.debug, installs beside the release)
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease  # Release APK with R8 (signs when keystore.properties exists)
./gradlew installDebug          # Build and install on a connected device or emulator
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest  # Instrumented tests (app/src/androidTest; needs a device)

./gradlew :shared:testAndroidHostTest --tests "com.rendyhd.vicu.worker.SyncEngineFailedActionsTest"
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "com.rendyhd.vicu.di.KoinGraphTest"
```

The gate for a change is `./gradlew test lint assembleDebug :shared:compileCommonMainKotlinMetadata`; CI runs exactly that, and a release additionally builds `:app:assembleRelease`. The metadata compile builds `commonMain` without the Android classpath, so Android or JVM-only API in common code fails on Linux too.

iOS (on a Mac with Xcode 26 and XcodeGen):

```bash
./gradlew :shared:iosSimulatorArm64Test   # shared tests on the iOS simulator (commonTest + iosTest)
iosApp/scripts/generate.sh                # Version.xcconfig + Vicu.xcodeproj from iosApp/project.yml
iosApp/scripts/build-speech.sh iphonesimulator   # native/speech for iOS (Gradle runs it before the cinterop)
xcodebuild -project iosApp/Vicu.xcodeproj -scheme Vicu -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17' build
node scripts/ui-verify-ios/install.mjs    # build, team-sign and install on a simulator
iosApp/scripts/testflight.sh              # archive the release app and upload it to TestFlight (the user runs it)
```

The iOS gate is the test task and the `xcodebuild` build; `.github/workflows/ios.yml` runs it on `main`. Run it after changing `commonMain` or `iosMain` when a Mac is at hand. Use JDK 17 or newer (CI uses Temurin 17; Android Studio's bundled JDK works locally).

Lint runs on `:app` (the shared module uses the AGP Kotlin Multiplatform library plugin, which has no lint task for its main sources). There is no lint baseline: keep `./gradlew lint` free of errors. There is no ktlint or detekt.

Versions live in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`. Compose Multiplatform dependencies are direct coordinates (the plugin's `compose.*` accessors are deprecated and the plugin is not applied). There is no Hilt, Retrofit or AppAuth. Annotation processing is KSP only (Room); never kapt. The KSP version must match the Kotlin version line.

## Module layout

Two Gradle modules, the iOS app outside Gradle, and the native speech library:

- **`:shared`** - Kotlin Multiplatform library (`com.android.kotlin.multiplatform.library` plugin, namespace `com.rendyhd.vicu.shared`). Almost all code lives in `commonMain`: data layer, sync engine, repositories, ViewModels, Compose screens and components. `androidMain` has the platform actuals (token storage, DataStore and Room builders, files, network monitor, OIDC launcher, pickers). `iosMain` has the iOS implementations (see "iOS"). Tests: `commonTest` (the bulk, run on the JVM and on the iOS simulator), `androidHostTest` (SQL against sqlite-jdbc using the exported Room schemas) and `iosTest` (Kotlin/Native: the iOS Koin graph, UI state codec, widget snapshots, share inbox).
- **`:app`** - the Android application (`com.rendyhd.vicu`): `MainActivity`, `VicuApplication`, the Android DI modules, alarms and notifications, Glance widgets, WorkManager workers, the OIDC login activity, the quick-add tile. Tests: `src/test` (JVM) and `src/androidTest` (instrumented).
- **`iosApp/`** - the iOS app, generated by XcodeGen from `project.yml` (the `.xcodeproj` is not checked in): the SwiftUI entry and app delegate (`Vicu/`), the widget extension with the Control Center control (`VicuWidgets/`), the share extension (`VicuShare/`), Swift shared by the app and an extension (`Shared/`), and `scripts/`.

- **`native/speech/`** - local speech (`docs/ai-assistant-v1.md`, section 3): `vicu_speech.h` / `.cpp`, a small C API over whisper.cpp (pinned by URL and SHA-256 in `CMakeLists.txt`, the same in the desktop app), `vicu_speech_jni.cpp` (Android only) and `models/ggml-silero-v6.2.0.bin`, the bundled voice detector. Android builds it through `externalNativeBuild` in `app/build.gradle.kts` into `libvicu_speech.so`; iOS through `iosApp/scripts/build-speech.sh` into a static archive that the shared module's cinterop (`shared/src/nativeInterop/cinterop/vicuSpeech.def`) links into the framework.

## Architecture

### MVVM with unidirectional data flow

```
UI (Compose)  -> observes StateFlow<UiState> from a ViewModel
ViewModel     -> calls repository functions, reads repository Flows
Repository    -> Room is the source of truth; writes are optimistic and queued; refreshers pull from the server
Remote        -> VikunjaApiService over a Ktor client; AuthManager supplies the token
```

### Dependency injection (Koin)

- `sharedModules` (in `shared/.../di/KoinModules.kt`): `databaseModule`, `networkModule`, `repositoryModule`, `commonModule` and `viewModelModule` (`ViewModelModule.kt`, `viewModelOf`; it takes at most 22 constructor parameters, so a larger view model needs a spelled-out `viewModel { ... }`). `androidAppModules` (in `app/.../di/AppModule.kt`): `appModule` (Android implementations of the platform interfaces, schedulers, OkHttp and Coil) and `workerModule` (`workerOf`). `VicuApplication` starts them together; iOS starts `sharedModules + iosModule`.
- Definitions are positional lambdas such as `TaskRepositoryImpl(taskDao = get(), ...)`. Adding a constructor parameter to a ViewModel, repository, refresher or worker means wiring it in the module as well. The compiler does not check that.
- **`KoinGraphTest`** (`app/src/test/.../di/`) builds every single, factory and ViewModel through Koin's `checkModules`, with only the Android edges replaced (empty Context, generated Room class with empty DAOs, a network monitor that registers nothing), and resolves each worker constructor argument. Run it after any DI change. A missing binding fails it with the missing type.
- Platform differences go through small interfaces implemented in `app` or `androidMain`: `PlatformRepositoryHooks` (alarms, widgets, sync trigger, completion sound), `PlatformAuthHooks`, `PlatformSettingsHooks`, `PlatformFiles`, `NetworkMonitor`, `TokenStorage`.
- Shared singletons worth knowing: `DayClock` (the local day as a flow), `TimeSource` (now and zone, replaced by fakes in tests), `AppMessages` (app-wide snackbar), `NavigationTicker`, `ScreenRefresher` and `SyncStaleness`, `ListPositioner`, `CarrierFinder`, `AppDispatchers`.

### Local data (Room)

`VikunjaDatabase` (database file `vicu_database`) is at **schema version 5**: `tasks` (with an indexed `isMetadata` column that marks hidden tasks so list queries can skip them in SQL, set by `HiddenTasks.isHidden`, and `assigneesJson`), `projects` (with `maxPermission`, -1 until known), `labels`, `pending_actions`, `attachments`, `routine_occurrence_archive`, and for collaboration `project_members`, `task_signals` (comment count and unread mark, kept apart from `tasks` so the task refresh cannot reset them) and `task_comments` (`CollaborationDao`). Migrations are in `DatabaseMigrations.kt`. Room exports the schema to `shared/schemas/` through the KSP argument `room.schemaLocation` set in `shared/build.gradle.kts`; commit the new `N.json` with any schema change, add a `Migration`, and extend `TaskMetadataMigrationTest`-style tests (they run the exported schema in sqlite-jdbc; `CollaborationMigrationTest` covers 3 to 4, `HiddenTasksMigrationTest` 4 to 5, which recomputes `isMetadata` with the marker rule in Kotlin). Preference stores (`*PrefsStore`, `CustomListStore`, `SyncCursorStore`, ...) are DataStore files created through `createDataStore`. `docs/settings.md` lists every setting and piece of per-device state, where it is stored and how it carries over (server sync, sign-out and account switch, backups, the desktop's counterpart); read it before adding a setting.

### Offline-first and sync

- Every write goes to Room first (optimistic) and, when it must reach the server, into the `pending_actions` queue. Entity types are `task`, `label`, `project`, and `assignee` and `comment` (queued per task, `entityId` is the task id; folded by `CollabQueueMerge.kt`, replayed by `CollaborationSync`). Updates are queued as JSON merge patches (only the changed fields); a later patch for the same entity is merged into the queued one (`queuePatchActionMerging`, `mergePatchPayloads` in `QueueMerge.kt`), and an old queue entry that still holds a whole object is turned into a patch when it is replayed. Project edits, archiving and review results are queued offline the same way as task edits. A change to an offline-created task is folded into its still-pending create. Offline-created tasks get negative temp ids from a persisted, decreasing counter (`TempIdGenerator`); `SyncEngine` remaps them when the create succeeds.
- `SyncEngine.performSync()` replays the queue (creates first) and then refreshes. **One sync runs at a time for the whole process** (a companion mutex; `SyncEngine.exclusive` for operations that rewrite the queue or wipe data). A 404 only drops a queued change when a follow-up request proves the thing is gone. Actions that fail permanently are kept as failed for 14 days; the app shows a banner with retry and discard. A session that needs sign-in leaves the queue untouched.
- Triggers: `SyncWorker` (immediate and when online), `PeriodicSyncWorker` (every 30 minutes; also repairs reminder alarms and widgets, even when the server is unreachable), and the screens' own refresh through `ScreenRefresher`. Task refresh is incremental (`SyncCursorStore`); the Logbook loads in pages.
- `LocalDataWiper` is the only place that clears local data. Work that has not reached the server survives a re-login, a logout and "clear cache" unless the user explicitly discards it or the account is gone; `SessionCleanup` and the Settings dialogs enforce the confirmation.
- Completed tasks stay visible, struck through, in the current screen for 5 s or until the user navigates away (`CompletionHold` in the screen's ViewModel; the row also stays put through a rotation), and a collapsed row joins one app-wide "Completed, Undo" snackbar (`CompletionToastCenter`). See "Design system, theme and motion".

### Vikunja API v2

Base URL `<server>/api/v2/` (a server in a sub-path works). The authoritative spec is the server's `GET /api/v2/openapi.json` (Vikunja 2.4.0 or newer is required; the desktop repo keeps a copy as `api-docs.json`). `docs/api-v2-migration-report.md` has the endpoint-by-endpoint migration from v1. The old v1 `docs.json` was removed.

- List endpoints answer with a pagination envelope; `VikunjaApiService` unwraps it and fetches all pages.
- Create is `POST` (HTTP 201), update is `PATCH` with JSON Merge Patch (`MergePatches` builds the patch from the previous and current object and only includes writable fields), delete returns 204 with no body.
- **Go zero values**: sending a field you did not mean to change zeroes it on the server, so never send a whole object back; send only what changed. To clear a due date send `"due_date": null`.
- The null date is `0001-01-01T00:00:00Z`; exclude it from due-date filters.

| Action | Method | Endpoint (relative to `/api/v2/`) |
|--------|--------|----------|
| List / search tasks | GET | `tasks?filter=...&sort_by=...&order_by=...&q=...&expand=subtasks` |
| Create / update / delete task | POST / PATCH / DELETE | `projects/{id}/tasks`, `tasks/{id}` |
| Projects and labels | GET / POST / PATCH / DELETE | `projects`, `projects/{id}`, `labels`, `labels/{id}` |
| Add / remove label on a task | POST / DELETE | `tasks/{id}/labels`, `tasks/{id}/labels/{labelId}` |
| Attachments | GET / POST / DELETE | `tasks/{id}/attachments`, `tasks/{id}/attachments/{attId}` (download streams) |
| Subtask relations | POST / DELETE | `tasks/{id}/relations`, `tasks/{id}/relations/{kind}/{otherId}` |
| Project views | GET | `projects/{id}/views`, `projects/{id}/views/{viewId}/tasks` (position order) |
| Task position | PUT | `tasks/{id}/position` |
| Server info, current user | GET | `info`, `user` |
| Password login, refresh, logout | POST | `login`, `user/token/refresh`, `logout` |
| OIDC token exchange | POST | `auth/openid/{provider}/callback` |
| API tokens | GET / POST / DELETE | `tokens`, `routes` |
| Project members, shares, find a person | GET / POST / PUT / DELETE | `projects/{id}/users/search`, `projects/{id}/users[/{username}]`, `projects/{id}/teams`, `users?q=` |
| Assignees | POST / DELETE | `tasks/{id}/assignees`, `tasks/{id}/assignees/{userId}` (never in a merge patch) |
| Comments, read, follow | GET / POST / PATCH / DELETE / PUT | `tasks/{id}/comments[/{cid}]`, `tasks/{id}/read`, `subscriptions/task/{id}` |
| Avatars | GET | `avatar/{username}?size=N` (through the image loader's placeholder host) |

### Smart lists

| List | Source | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Inbox | the configured Inbox project | In the Inbox project's task order (by default dated first, then the list view's position); the user can drag to reorder where the order allows. Observes the project id, says so when none is selected. |
| Today | open tasks whose local due date is today or earlier | Overdue section above Today; ends at the start of local tomorrow |
| Upcoming | open tasks whose local due date is tomorrow or later | |
| Anytime | all open tasks except the Inbox | Grouped by project at every level |
| Logbook | done tasks | Loaded in pages |
| Review | projects by review status | Same math as desktop |
| Routines | routine carrier tasks | See Routines |
| Tag | one label | Filters before hiding nested subtasks |
| Custom list | user-defined filter | See Custom lists |

Server filters use local-day boundaries converted to UTC; the client then filters exactly (`DueDates`, `CustomListFilterBuilder`).

## Cross-app contract

`docs/cross-app-semantics-v1.md` is the contract for how both apps interpret synced data (due dates, local days, weeks, custom-list windows, review math, quick-add parsing, routine merge and archive). It is identical in the desktop repo, together with `docs/description-format-v1.md`. The machine-readable vectors are in `test-fixtures/` and must stay byte-identical in both repos:

- `cross-app-semantics-v1.json` (loaded by `CrossAppFixture`, `DueDatesFixtureTest`, `CustomListFixtureTest`, ...)
- `nlp-corpus-v1.json` (`NlpCorpusTest`)
- `routine-archive-v1.json` (`RoutineArchiveFixtureTest`, `RoutineMergeFixtureTest`)
- `description-format-v1.json`
- `design-tokens-v1.json` (the design-system values: `docs/design-system-v1.md`; `cross-app-semantics-v1.json` also holds the `completion` and `dateDisplay` vectors)

When behavior changes, change the fixture first, in both repos, in the same release. Fixtures write local wall-clock times; tests convert them with an explicit zone, and the routine vectors run with each contract zone as the system zone.

`docs/design-system-v1.md` is the design-system contract (colour roles and contrast, label chips, priority marks, motion, haptics). `SharedContractIdentityTest` compares all shared fixtures and docs with a desktop checkout next to this repo (skipped when absent; Gradle does not track those files, so use `--rerun` to force it).

Rules that follow from the contract and are easy to break:

- **Time comes from `TimeSource` and the day from `DayClock`.** Never call `Clock.System` or `TimeZone.currentSystemDefault()` in logic that needs testing. `DayClock` re-reads the local day at midnight, on resume and on a date, time or zone change (`DayChangeReceiver`); screens collect it instead of freezing the date they saw.
- **All due dates go through `DueDates`.** A date-only due date is stored as local 23:59:59; legacy 00:00:00 values are read as date-only. **All date text goes through `DateDisplay`** (see "Design system, theme and motion").
- Weeks start on Monday. Today is the local calendar date.

## Collaboration (assignees, comments, sharing)

Contract: `docs/cross-app-semantics-v1.md` section 9 (rules and endpoints) and `docs/design-system-v1.md` sections 4 and 4.1 (row signals, Assign and Comments chips); the vectors are the `collaboration` block of `cross-app-semantics-v1.json` (`CollaborationFixtureTest`). `util/Collaboration.kt` is the port of the shared rules (names, the shared rule, member permissions, comment HTML encode and decode, mention suggestions). Nothing shows on a project nobody else can see.

- **Data**: `CollaborationRepository` (`CollaborationRepositoryImpl`): `state` (`CollabState`: you and every project's `ProjectAccess` from `project_members` and `maxPermission`), `signals`, `refresh` (members at most every 10 minutes, then the signals of the open tasks of shared projects with `expand=comment_count` and `expand=is_unread`; called by `ScreenRefresher` and `SyncEngine`), assignees and comments through the task write gate (optimistic, queued offline, rolled back when refused), mark read, follow, and sharing (online only, through `ProjectActions`).
- **API tokens** (contract 9.7): Vikunja answers 401 when an API token lacks a route group (comments, assignees, sharing; no token may follow tasks). On a 401 from a collaboration endpoint (`KtorClientFactory.isCollaborationPath`) with the stored API token (the user's or the backup token), the 401 interceptor first asks `GET projects?per_page=1` with the same token, outside the refresh lock (`ApiTokenCheck`, one check a minute, no answer counts as working). When it still reads projects the session stays and `VikunjaApiService` throws a 403 with `tokenPermission` and a message from `ApiTokenPermission`, so a queued change fails visibly instead of pausing the queue for sign-in. The Comments screen offers Notify me only for password and OIDC sign-ins (`Collaboration.canFollowTasks`).
- **UI**: `CollabViewModel` feeds `LocalCollab` (`CollabUi`) at the app root. Rows (`TaskItem`) show the comment count on the meta line (its own 48 dp target, opens the comments) and the assignee avatars first in the trailing cluster; the editor has Assign (`AssignSheet`) after Project and Comments after the attachment chip; `TaskCommentsScreen` (`TaskCommentsViewModel`) is an overlay over the editor or the list, drawn by `VicuApp` with the editor's `EditorOverlay`; "Shared with" is `ProjectSharingSection` in `ProjectEditDialog` (admins only). Avatars are `PersonAvatar` (the server image over an initial).

## Custom lists, routines and hidden sync metadata

Custom lists, routines and the synced settings store data in ordinary Vikunja tasks that the apps hide ("hidden tasks", contract section 10; `docs/hidden-tasks.md` describes each kind, `docs/synced-data-architecture.md` the design and its decision record). The rules every kind follows are in `HiddenTasks` (`util/`): a task is hidden when its description holds any `<!-- vicu-<kind>:` marker, known or not (`isMetadata`); a hidden task belongs to the user who created it (`created_by`, through `CurrentUser`, which `AuthManager` implements), and the app reads, writes and deletes only its own, so a shared project never mixes two people's data; a reopened carrier is still the carrier; every write sends the forced fields (`putForcedFields`). Carriers of a kind are found by `CarrierFinder` (`CarrierSpec.CUSTOM_LISTS`, `CarrierSpec.PREFS`) by remembered id, `q` search and a daily scan. A search the server answers with an error (`VikunjaApiException.isBrokenSearch`: a status other than 401; a ParadeDB extension older than its library answers every search with 500) finds nothing new and the last daily scan stands, while the full reconcile's routine carriers and the archive parts are then read from a listing of the done tasks (contract 10.4). Document kinds (custom lists, preferences) sync through `SyncedDocumentSync` (`data/sync/`), generic over a `SyncedDocumentCodec`: merge every own carrier, drop tombstones older than 90 days, write the lowest id, read it back, delete covered duplicates; a newer version's carrier is "update required" and never written:

- **Synced preferences** (contract section 11): `SyncedPreferences` keeps one entry per setting the user chose in the `vicu-prefs:v1` carrier (local copy `SyncedPrefsStore`, DataStore `synced_prefs`, account-specific). Defaults are never written; null is a reset that reaches every device; unknown keys and values are kept. Registered keys: `inbox_project_id` (the Inbox: `chooseInbox` writes it, a sync brings another device's choice into `AuthManager`'s Inbox, setup preselects it), the task order (`TaskOrderPreferences`), and saved places and location reminders (`place.<id>` with the name, `location_reminder.<taskId>` with place, trigger and radius; contract 11.7; `LocationRepository` joins them with the positions this phone keeps in `SavedPlacesStore`, which never sync; a reminder at an unsaved spot or of a temp-id task stays in `LocationReminderStore`; only phones fire, the desktop only picks), the per-person choices about shared routines (`routine_reminders.<id>` "off", `routine_hidden.<id>` true; `RoutinePersonalPreferences`), and the project categories (`category.<id>`, `category.project.<projectId>`; see Project categories below). A new key goes in the contract's registry first. `SyncEngine` syncs it after the custom lists.
- **Custom lists** sync through a carrier task whose description holds a `vicu-custom-lists:v1` marker (`CustomListEnvelope`, `CustomListRepositoryImpl`). `CarrierFinder` finds the carrier by remembered id before searching. A list has a name, icon, project and label filters, a due-date window with an **Include overdue tasks** switch, and a sort; unknown fields from a newer client are preserved. They are evaluated on the device by one evaluator (`CustomListFilterBuilder.visibleTasks`, fed by `customListSource`), so the screen and the widget agree; the server filter the same class builds is only a superset of the exact window. The collaboration and activity conditions (contract section 3.3, vectors `customListActivity`: `assigned`, `comments`, `shared_only`, `changed_within_days`) also read a `CustomListContext` (you, the shared projects, the signals; `CustomListContext.of(state, signals)`), which `CustomListViewModel` and `TaskWidgetWorker` build from `CollaborationRepository`. Assigned and Comments only match tasks of shared projects. A list that shows done tasks and looks at comments reads their signals with `refreshSignalsFor` (the regular signal refresh reads open tasks only and keeps those rows); `ReadKeeper` keeps a task you read in an Unread list until you leave it. The wire writes the four keys only when set (`@EncodeDefault(NEVER)`) and keeps an unknown string value; the editor shows the Shared projects section while something is shared or the list already has a condition, and saves a copy of the filter so conditions it does not show (priorities set on desktop) are kept.
- **Routines** keep their definition and recent history in carrier tasks (`vicu-routine:` marker, `RoutineEnvelope`; merge rules in the contract). A routine keeps its last 400 days; older history moves to **archive parts on the server**: done tasks titled "Vicu routine archive" in the project of the routine's main carrier, read and written by `RoutineArchiveStore` straight through the API (never through Room). `routine_occurrence_archive` in Room holds history that older versions kept only on the phone until `SyncEngine` has uploaded it once (the upload needs a connection). Carriers are created done in one request and skip list positioning. The routine CSV export guards cells a spreadsheet would run as formulas.
- **Carrier writes** (contract 6.8): every write of a routine carrier or archive part goes through `RoutineCarrierWriter`: read, merge, a JSON Patch whose first operation tests the description read (422: read, merge, send again), then a read-back after `VERIFY_DELAY`, because Vikunja lets two writes made at the same moment both pass the test; what was lost is written again, a 5xx is retried, `MAX_WRITES` in all. `TaskRefresher` writes back this device's recent records a refresh finds missing (`SharedRoutines.lostOwnChanges`, `routineDeviceId`). `LiveRoutineRaceTest` (androidHostTest) races two people against a real server when `VICU_LIVE_RACE` and `VICU_LIVE_RACE_TASK` are set; otherwise it does nothing.
- **Shared routines** (contract 6.9, design `docs/shared-routines.md`): a routine is shared through a project the user already shares (`definition.shared`; the carrier and its parts live in that project). `RoutineRepositoryImpl.share` / `stopSharing` (owner only, online only), the editor's "Share with" (`ShareWithField` in `RoutinesScreen.kt`, people and projects from `RoutineSharing.kt`), `loggedBy` on a shared routine's records ("Done by Maya"). Another user's carrier is read when it is shared (`SharedRoutines.readsCarrier`, `TaskRefresher.checkSharedCarriers`); every part of a routine the app reads counts (`countsPart`). Members with write access tick and edit; view-only members only look; only the owner stops sharing, archives or deletes. A member can turn their reminders off or hide it (`HiddenRoutinesViewModel`, Settings). Its reminders read the carrier again before they ring, as every routine reminder does. Deleting or archiving a project that holds one says so (`rememberSharedRoutineNames`), and the delete question is asked even with "Confirm before deleting" off (`RoutineSharing.asksBeforeDeleting`).

## AI assistant (bring your own model)

Contract: `docs/ai-assistant-v1.md` with `test-fixtures/ai-tools-v1.json` (identical in the desktop repo; `AiToolsFixtureTest` runs its vectors). Off until the user sets up a provider in Settings, Assistant (`AssistantTab`, `AssistantSettingsViewModel`: Thinking with the provider and one model, Ask's own only on request, a model tested as soon as it is chosen or a feature needs it; the features, each saying where to find it, with Try it; Hearing with the speech models), tests it and agrees to what is sent; there is no Vicu server and the app shows no prices.

- **The fixture is the source.** `:shared:generateAiContract` writes the fixture's text into `AiContractSource` (a generated constant); `AiContract` reads the prompts, schemas, tools, presets, limits and speech models from it, so the app sends exactly the fixture's text. Change the fixture (both repos) to change a prompt, and raise that prompt's `version`.
- **Providers** (`ai/provider/`): `LlmClient` over its own Ktor client (never the Vikunja one), the `openai-chat` and `anthropic-messages` protocols in `WireProtocols.kt` (streamed SSE, tool calls assembled per id, Anthropic's content blocks kept raw in `ChatMessage.Assistant.raw` and sent back unchanged, `output_config.format` / `response_format` json_schema, no `temperature` on Anthropic, a refused optional field left out and remembered per model), `StructuredAnswers` (one repair), `AiProviders.test` (Test connection with the fixture's probe). The key is in `AiKeyStore` (platform: Tink / Keychain), the rest in `AiSettingsStore`; both are device settings that never sync.
- **Dictation** (`ai/dictation/`): `DictationService` builds the `<context>` (`DictationRequests`, key order and sorting as the contract says), `DictationChecks` runs the 11 checks (the quick-add parser with dates only reads `when.said`), `DictationController` is the app-wide flow behind `DictationSheet` (draft cards: `DraftCard`, dashed outline for guessed fields, voice edits, Add with one Undo, Retry / Add as one task, a failed transcript kept in `KeptTranscriptStore`), `DraftWriter` creates through `createQueued`. Holding + and letting go is always quick capture (one task, no model); sliding up to the lock (`FabGesture`, `HoldToTalk.lock`) opens the sheet with the microphone on: `DictationMic` sends each turn of the open microphone (contract 3.7) as a dictation, then as edits of the drafts, and talking again cancels a request still running. "Break into steps" (task menu), "Make tasks from this" (shared text) and Try it in Settings start it too. **Brain dump** (contract 4.8) is the sheet's switch (remembered as `AiSettings.brainDump`, also in Settings, with a note under it saying what it does): turns go into an editable dump instead of to the model (`DictationController.addWords`, the open mic's `dump_idle_s`), Organize sends it once (`DictationService.runBrainDump`, `BrainDumpChecks`: new projects and subprojects by ref, merged by path into existing ones), the plan lists the tasks under their projects (`PlanList` in `DictationSheet`), Update sends what was said or typed since as an edit with a `<plan>` block, and `PlanWriter` creates the new projects (online only) before the tasks, with one Undo.
- **Ask and Talk** (`ai/ask/`, `ui/screens/ask/`): `AskSession` (context block, ≤ 8 tool rounds, the 40-message window, proposal cards that suspend until Apply or Decline), `AskSnapshot` (task summaries, `get_overview`, `find_tasks` through the custom-list evaluator, `list_view`, `get_task`; hidden tasks never included), `Proposals` (skip reasons, merge patches, notes only appended, Undo), `ConversationStore` (last 5, cleared with the account by `LocalDataWiper`). Once Ask is on, it opens as a sheet over the list it is about (`AskSheet`, drawn by `VicuApp` with an app-level `AskViewModel`; small at the bottom until something is asked, then 80% of the screen) from the sparkle next to Search in every list's top bar (`LocalOpenAsk`, the list through `AskEntry`), the drawer and Settings' Try it; `AskRoute` is only left for a restored back stack. A conversation idle for `context_refresh_minutes` makes way for a new one when Ask opens. Talk is the open microphone in Ask (a toggle): each turn is the next message, talking again cancels a turn still running (`AskSession.withdraw`), answers are read by `SpeechOutput` while the microphone pauses (it keeps listening through headphones, `SpeechOutput.playsPrivately`), an open card is read aloud and answered by `SpokenConfirmation`.
- **Local speech** (`speech/`): whisper.cpp v1.9.5 through `native/speech/vicu_speech.h` (Whisper, Parakeet, the bundled Silero VAD), behind `SpeechEngineNative`. `LocalSpeechSession` records (`AudioRecorder`), cuts phrases (`PhraseCutter`, `speech.vad`) and transcribes each on one thread of `SpeechEngineHost` while the user talks; `VocabularyHint` is Whisper's prompt; `SpeechModelManager` downloads models (Range resume, `Sha256`, Wi-Fi unless allowed). `SelectingSpeechInput` gives hold-to-talk local speech when a model is chosen, else the platform recognizer; `openMic` gives the open microphone (`voice/OpenMic.kt`: `LocalOpenMic` with the detector's `TurnWatch` events, `PlatformOpenMic` an utterance at a time, `TurnSender` for what goes out; `speech.turn` in the fixture).

## Guided organizing

Contract: `docs/cross-app-semantics-v1.md` section 14 (vectors: the `guided` block, `GuidedFixtureTest`, in the three contract zones) and `docs/ai-assistant-v1.md` sections 5.7 and 9 (vectors: `organize.checks` in `AiToolsFixtureTest`). The desktop has the same in `src/shared/guided.ts` and `src/shared/ai/organize.ts`. The app leads and the model advises: a session takes a queue and shows one decision at a time; nothing needs the assistant, and with Ask set up a model suggests each decision, which the person still confirms.

- **Rules** (`util/Guided.kt`): the queues (`inbox`, `overdue`, `waiting`: undated, not repeating, untouched 60+ days; and the projects due for review), a project's health line, `ago`, the weekly review's steps and Ask's agenda, over a `GuidedWorld` (tasks without hidden ones, projects, Inbox, day, review settings, task orders, permissions). `GuidedWorldSource` builds it from the repositories for every screen.
- **Card sessions** (`GuidedSortScreen`, `GuidedSortViewModel`, route `GuidedSortRoute(kind)`): a card's choices are a `CardDraft` (When quick choices, a picked date or No date; project; title) written together on Next through `GuidedWriter` (Proposals' update path: merge patch, project move, queued offline); Complete and Delete write at once; Back shows the previous card as it is now. `GuidedLog` keeps each task's state from before the session for the summary ("Sorted 4: 1 scheduled, 1 without a date now, 1 moved, 1 completed", the desktop's wording) and Undo all (everything but deletes).
- **Project review** (`GuidedReviewScreen`, `GuidedReviewViewModel`, `GuidedReviewRoute`): one page per project with the health line, Keep or Archive (`ProjectActions`), the untouched tasks, the next step (the model's pick or the first open task; a new one can be named) and Mark reviewed. Changes on a page are written at once; Undo all also puts back reviews, archives and added tasks.
- **Weekly review** (`WeeklyReviewScreen`, `WeeklyReviewViewModel`, `WeeklyReviewRoute`): the steps in GTD order; a session that runs to its end ticks its step through `GuidedProgress`; Anything on your mind opens brain dump (`DictationMic.tryIt`) or quick add; Finish writes the synced `weekly_review.last` (`WeeklyReviewPreferences`).
- **Suggestions** (`ai/organize/`): `OrganizeService` (an `OrganizeSuggester`) sends a batch of 20 tasks (the next one 5 cards ahead; a review page sends its project) with Ask's model and Ask's agreement, no setting of its own; `OrganizeRequests` builds the text exactly as the desktop does; `OrganizeChecks` runs the 9.3 checks. A suggestion fills the card's choices with the dashed outline and shows its reason; `close` only highlights Complete or Delete. A failed request is said once and the session goes on without.
- **Entry points**: Ask's agenda and starters when a conversation is empty (`AskAgenda`, `AskViewModel.guide`, `startersKind`), the Inbox's top bar, the Review screen's Start review and Weekly review; `NavHostController.openGuided(id)` opens any of them.

## Authentication

Three methods, chosen on the setup screen (server URL, discover, authenticate, pick the Inbox project):

1. **OIDC (SSO)** - a WebView (`OidcLoginActivity`; iOS: the WKWebView in `OidcLauncher.ios.kt`) intercepts the redirect; the code is exchanged at Vikunja's own callback endpoint (not at the identity provider). **OIDC sign-in** has two modes (`OidcSignInMode`, `auth/OidcSignIn.kt`): the web view, with Vikunja's frontend callback as redirect (no provider setup), and the browser. The web views cannot do passkeys (Android's WebView has no WebAuthn without Digital Asset Links from the provider's domain; WKWebView serves only the app's associated domains), so a passkey-first provider such as Pocket ID failed there with "An unknown error occurred". Every page of the web view gets `OidcBrowserSignIn.passkeyGuardScript` (Android: `evaluateJavascript` on page start and finish, signalled through `console.info`; iOS: a document-start `WKUserScript` and the `vicuPasskey` message handler), which refuses a modal passkey request at once (and supplies `PublicKeyCredential` where it is missing, so the page reaches the guard instead of its own support check); the sign-in then ends with `PASSKEY_UNAVAILABLE`, `OidcHandler` answers `OidcResult.PasskeyUnavailable`, and Setup shows the browser step (`SetupStep.OidcBrowser`). The browser sign-in redirects to `com.rendyhd.vicu:/oidc-callback` (`OidcBrowserSignIn.REDIRECT_URI`, the same in every build; added once to the Vikunja client at the provider; Vikunja exchanges the code with it): Android opens a Custom Tab through the plain intent extra (`OidcBrowserActivity`, `singleTask`; the exported `OidcRedirectActivity` hands the redirect back; returning without one is a cancel), iOS uses `ASWebAuthenticationSession` (Safari's passkeys, not ephemeral). The desktop app does the same with a loopback redirect (vicu `src/shared/oidc-browser.ts`).
2. **Password + TOTP** - `POST login` with `long_token`. A 412 problem with code 1017 means a TOTP code is required. An empty error detail from the server falls back to a readable message.
3. **API token** - pasted by the user and tested against `user`.

`AuthManager` holds the session: the JWT with its rotating refresh cookie, proactive refresh, a backoff policy per failure kind, a mutex so refreshes never overlap, and a fallback to the backup API token (`POST tokens`, titled per device) before it reports `NeedsReAuth`. `KtorClientFactory` adds the bearer token and treats `login`, `info`, `user/token/refresh` and `auth/openid/...` as token-free by whole path segment. Every request to the server carries the User-Agent `Vicu/<version> (<platform>; <device>)` (`VikunjaUserAgent`), which Vikunja lists as the session's device under Settings, Sessions; the desktop sends the same form with the computer's name. Tokens are stored by `AndroidSecureTokenStorage` (Tink AEAD, Android Keystore master key). `AccountSession` and `SessionCleanup` handle account switches and sign-out.

## Reminders, notifications and widgets

- **Per-task reminders**: exact alarms (`AlarmScheduler`, `ReminderAlarmCoordinator`, `ReminderAlarmRegistry`) planned from `task.reminders` by the pure rules in `ReminderAlarms`; relative reminders count from the date named in `relative_to`. An alarm re-checks the task when it fires, so a completed or removed task leaves no ghost reminder. "Mark Complete" in a notification completes and never reopens; "Snooze" goes through `SnoozeStore`. `BootReceiver`, the periodic sync and app start repair the alarms. Needs `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` handling on Android 12+ (a banner explains it).
- **Daily summaries** (morning and optional afternoon): each slot is a chain of one-time works (`DailySummaryScheduler`, `DailySummaryWorker`) aimed at the local wall-clock time, re-queued by the run itself and made sure at app start. Counting follows the desktop rules (`DailySummary`).
- **Routine reminders**: `RoutineAlarmScheduler` and the routine action receivers. When an alarm fires, `RoutineReminderCheck` reads the routine's carrier from the server (8 s at most; offline the phone's copy decides) and stays quiet for an occurrence done or skipped on any device.
- **Notification channels**: `task_reminders`, `daily_summary` and `routine_reminders` (see `NotificationChannelManager`).
- **Widgets** (Glance, not Compose: different imports): `TaskListWidget` (Today, Inbox, Upcoming, Anytime, a project or a custom list; tap to complete) and `RoutineWidget`. State files live under `WidgetStateFiles` and are excluded from backups. A project or Inbox widget lists its tasks in that project's task order (see Lists). Taps and notifications open the app through a typed `ViewTarget`; its Intent wire form is frozen because installed widgets and posted notifications hold it.

## UI notes

- Navigation: `AppNavHost` with `@Serializable` routes (`Routes.kt`), one top-level navigation behavior (`TopLevelNavigation`), a drawer with a nested project tree, and configurable bottom-bar slots. The views above the drawer's projects (Today, Upcoming and Anytime while the bar does not hold them, Logbook, Routines, Review, Ask) can each be hidden there (`DrawerView`, `BehaviorPrefs.hiddenDrawerViews`, Settings, General, Drawer; `drawerViewChoices` decides what is offered); a device setting, which the desktop has for its sidebar (`sidebar_hidden_lists`). The task detail is a sheet that autosaves edits and keeps them across process death; it closes when pulled down by its header or past the top of its list (`EditorPull.kt`, its own gesture, not a `ModalBottomSheet`, whose drag shakes a scrolling child).
- Quick add parses natural language as you type (`util/parser/`, Todoist or Vikunja syntax); the rules are shared with the desktop and covered by the NLP corpus.
- Quick add (`TaskEntrySheet`) is Vicu's own sheet over the screens, not a `ModalBottomSheet`: it rides on the keyboard (`SheetLayout` reads the keyboard's room while laying out, so the sheet fades in on the navigation bar and goes up with the keyboard frame by frame, and nothing recomposes during the slide; on Android the keyboard's animation runs on the UI thread, so per-frame recomposition there made the keyboard stutter), its one line of chips (When, Remind, Priority; tags, a project and a repeat only once set) open trays in the keyboard's place (`QuickAddTrays.kt`), and the expand button grows the same sheet to full height with a row per property and a checklist. Nothing is saved until Send or Add.
- Calendars (the When sheet, the reminder picker's date step) are `MonthCalendar` (`ui/components/picker/`): six Monday-first weeks from `WhenLogic.monthGrid`, the same grid as the desktop When panel, with the arrows and a horizontal swipe to change the month.
- Lists: swipe right to complete, swipe left to choose when, by default; each direction's action is a device setting (Settings, Gestures: `SwipeAction` in `BehaviorPrefs`, named and drawn by `SwipeActions`; the row completes the task itself and the app root's `TaskRowActions.swipe` runs the rest, with the When sheet, the project picker and `DeleteTaskDialog`); drag handles reorder; every reorderable row also has Move up and Move down actions for TalkBack; small controls have 48dp targets. Multi-select ends when the user navigates away (`NavigationTicker`). Duplicate (the editor's menu and the selection's menu) goes through `TaskDuplicator` (contract section 15: fields, labels, assignees on a shared project and subtasks, through the ordinary create, so it works offline); the selection's Copy titles puts the titles on the clipboard, one per line.
- Task order (contract section 12; `TaskOrder`, `TaskOrderSettings`, `TaskOrderPreferences`, synced through the preferences carrier as `task_order` and `task_order.project.<id>`): a global order (Settings, Projects, Display) and a per-project override ("Sort tasks" in the project menu, the Inbox's sort button). A project without its own follows its nearest parent with one, then the global order; sections and widgets (`TaskWidgetStates`, so iOS too) follow the project they show. `sortProjectTasks(tasks, order)` sorts by the contract rules (parsed dates, lowercased titles, ties by position then id); the reorder helpers (`isManuallyOrdered`, `moveTaskInList`, `moveOptions`, `planDrop`, ...) take the order: every row drags in Manual, undated rows in the default (Due date, then manual), none in the sorted orders. Choosing the default writes no value; a project's "Default" writes null so the reset reaches the other devices.
- Holding the + listens for a task (`HoldToTalk` over the `SpeechInput` seam, the voice card in `FabOverlays`; sliding up locks it into smart dictation), and dragging it onto a header that carries a day or project (`Modifier.fabDropTarget`) opens quick add with it preset; a tap is unchanged. See `docs/voice-input.md`.
- The + button is drawn once, by `AppFab` in `VicuApp` over the NavHost, so screen transitions never fade it. A screen puts its button in with `ScreenFab` (label, expanded, onClick) in its Scaffold's `floatingActionButton` slot, which keeps the button's place free for the screen's snackbar; leave `ScreenFab` out (no button, or during a selection) and the button hides. Screens are told apart by their back stack entry id. Between screens peers cross-fade (`NavTransitions`); into a child project or Search is a 30 dp shared-axis slide.
- Between peers the screen navigated to fades in once it has its content: a list screen calls `ScreenReady(!state.isLoading)`, `RevealedScreen` (every destination in `AppNavHost` is wrapped in it) waits for that (at most `REVEAL_WAIT_MS`) and then fades in, and the old screen is held under it and stops being drawn once it is covered (`ScreenReveal`). A fade that started at once showed the empty screen and froze half-way on the frame that built the rows. `navigateTopLevel` saves the screen being left when it is a smart list or Settings, wherever the move goes, so going home and back restores Today with its content instead of building a new view model.
- Search shows cached matches at once (titles, descriptions, completed tasks) and refreshes in the background.
- Descriptions are HTML in Vikunja; the Cascade editor edits them and unknown blocks are preserved (`docs/description-format-v1.md`).
- Attachments: open, share or save (Android: to Downloads; iOS: the Files "Save to" sheet) any file type, streamed to the cache, checked against the server's size limit before upload.
- Share target: a share becomes a task with the shared text as title and description and shared files attached; it survives rotation.
- **Project categories** (contract section 13, header style in design-system section 5): optional named headers that group the top-level projects of the drawer, the Projects tab of Settings and the project pickers. The rules are `ProjectCategories` (`util/`, run against the `projectCategories` vectors in `ProjectCategoriesFixtureTest`): reading, the layout (`ProjectCategoryState.group`) and each change planned as the entries to write. `ProjectCategoryPreferences` writes them as one change (`SyncedEntries.setAll`); every category action goes through `ProjectActions` (create, rename, move, delete with Undo, Move to category…, Add category above, a drop into another category with `moveIntoCategory`). The lists are built by `projectListItems` (`ui/navigation/ProjectListItems.kt`: headers between rows, `moveProjectItem` for a drag past a header, `droppedPlace`, `levelSiblings` for Move up / Move down within a category); the header, the name dialog and the Move to category dialog are in `ui/components/category/`. `LocalProjectCategories` (app root) feeds the pickers. Only top-level projects have a category (`ProjectCategories.isTopLevel`); the Inbox never does. Collapsed categories are per device and last while the app runs.
- Settings has four tabs in a `PrimaryScrollableTabRow`: General, Projects, Notifications, Gestures. Projects holds the Inbox choice, the project list (tap a row to edit it, drag or Move up / Move down within its level, the row menu for the rest, archived projects in a collapsed Archived group), Display, Review with the projects excluded from it, Labels and Custom Lists. Every project action (create, add subproject, edit, set as Inbox, archive, restore, delete, mark reviewed, include in review again, sibling moves) goes through `ProjectActions` (`ui/screens/shared/`, a Koin single), whether it starts in Settings, at the drawer's + or in the project screen's menu, so each answers with the same message everywhere; add a new project action there, not in a ViewModel.

## Design system, theme and motion

`docs/design-system-v1.md` is the contract (identical in the desktop repo) and `test-fixtures/design-tokens-v1.json` holds its values (byte-identical; the `android` block has the Material 3 colour schemes generated from the seed #0A66D1, custom colours, contrast pairs and the motion scheme). Change the doc and the fixture in both repos first; the tests below fail when code drifts from the fixture.

- **Theme** (`ui/theme/`): `VicuTheme(themeMode, dynamicColor, pureBlack)` in `Theme.kt` picks `VicuLightColorScheme` / `VicuDarkColorScheme` (`Color.kt`) and applies `Typography` (`Type.kt`) and `VicuShapes` (`Shape.kt`). The Vicu scheme is the default. **Use device colours** (Settings, General, appearance; `ThemePrefsStore.useDeviceColors`, default off, Android 12 and later) switches to the wallpaper scheme (`dynamicLightColorScheme` / `dynamicDarkColorScheme`). **Pure black** (`ThemePrefsStore.pureBlack`, default off, offered unless the theme is Light) makes the dark scheme's page roles (`background`, `surface`, `surfaceDim`, `surfaceContainerLowest`) black through `ColorScheme.withPureBlack()` (`VicuBlackColorScheme`, or the wallpaper scheme with device colours); the raised containers keep their values. It has no desktop counterpart and is not in the fixture; `AndroidContrastTest` and `PureBlackSchemeTest` cover it. Material 3 does not cover everything, so `VicuColors` (`VicuColors.kt`: due today, done, swipe complete and schedule as `VicuColorRole` with on-colour and containers; priority colours; smart list identity colours) is provided through `LocalVicuColors` (read `LocalVicuColors.current`). Overdue has no custom colour: it is `colorScheme.error`. With device colours on, `VicuColors.harmonizedWith(colorScheme.primary)` shifts the status and swipe colours towards the wallpaper primary; priority and identity colours keep their hue so marks and list icons stay told apart. Identity colours only ever colour list icons, never text. Components never hard-code a colour: take it from `MaterialTheme.colorScheme`, `LocalVicuColors`, `LabelChipColors`, `PriorityMark` or `SmartListIdentity`.
- **Harmonize port** (`ui/theme/color/`: `Blend.kt` with the reduced `Hct`, `Cam16.kt`, `HctSolver.kt`, `ColorUtils.kt`): a small port of material-color-utilities' `Blend.harmonize` in common Kotlin (Apache 2.0 header kept), because MDC is not a dependency and is not to be added. `HarmonizeVectorsTest` (`androidHostTest`) checks it against vectors generated once with material-color-utilities 0.4.0 (`harmonize-vectors-v1.json`); `HarmonizedColorsTest` pins what harmonising may and may not change. `Contrast.kt` has `contrastRatio` and `ensureContrast`.
- **`VicuMotion`** (`Motion.kt`) is a plain `object` holding the motion tokens: the six scheme slots (`fastSpatial`, `defaultSpatial`, `slowSpatial`, `fastEffects`, `defaultEffects`, `slowEffects` as `VicuSpring` damping and stiffness, with `...Spec()` functions) and the named motions (`fade.fast`, `fade.base`, `move`, `moveExpressive`, `pop`, page, stagger, check and strike draw). It does not implement `MotionScheme` and is not passed to `MaterialTheme`: Compose Multiplatform material3 1.9.0 (and androidx 1.4.0) keep `MotionScheme` internal and `MaterialTheme` has no public `motionScheme` parameter, so components read `VicuMotion` directly. Material 3 Expressive (`MotionScheme.expressive()`, FAB menu, floating toolbar, connected button groups, `LoadingIndicator`) is deferred until a stable multiplatform material3 exposes it (recorded in the design doc); revisit then and keep `VicuMotion` unless the factory's values equal the tokens. Every animation needs a reduced variant (fade only, no transform or overshoot) that follows the system animator scale.
- **Token tests** (`shared/src/commonTest/.../ui/theme/`): `DesignTokensFixture` loads `design-tokens-v1.json` through `CrossAppFixture.readTestFixture`; `DesignTokensTest` compares both colour schemes, typography sizes and weights (nothing under 11 sp), shape radii, custom, priority and identity colours and the motion scheme and named motions with the fixture; `AndroidContrastTest` resolves the `android.contrast` pairs per theme. Component level: `LabelChipColorsTest`, `PriorityMarkTest`, `SmartListIdentityTest`. `SharedContractIdentityTest` (`util/`) compares every shared fixture (`design-tokens-v1.json` included) and doc (`design-system-v1.md` included) with a desktop checkout next to this repo (`VICU_DESKTOP_DIR` overrides; skipped when absent; Gradle does not track those files, so use `--rerun`).
- **Date display** (`util/DateDisplay.kt`): `DateDisplay.format` and `formatDue` phrase a date for a `DateContext` (row, row in Today, row in a day group, chip, day and full headers, logbook group and time) from a `DateDisplayFormat` (device locale and 12 or 24 hour clock: `DateDisplayFormat.system(is24Hour)`, `LocalIs24Hour` in the UI). It is the same rule set as the desktop `src/shared/date-display.ts` (contract section 8); English is built from fixed names and patterns, never platform locale data, so java.time and ICU agree, and the `dateDisplay` vectors of `cross-app-semantics-v1.json` run in `DateDisplayTest`. Do not format a date for display with `DateTimeFormatter` or string templates in a screen.
- **Completion hold** (contract section 7): `CompletionHoldMachine` (`ui/screens/shared/`) is the pure state machine, the same as the desktop `src/shared/completion-hold.ts` (no timers: every call takes the time; `CompletionHold.HOLD_MILLIS` 5 s, `TOAST_MILLIS` 6 s), run against the `completion` vectors in `CompletionHoldMachineTest`. What the app runs is `CompletionHold` (keeps the row in place, struck through, for the hold; ends on undo, on a new destination through `NavigationTicker`, or on a failed change) and `CompletionToastCenter` (collapsed rows merge into "Completed" / "3 completed" with Undo on the app-wide snackbar, the 6 s clock restarting per row). The phone has no pointer, so the engagement half of the machine is unused here. Tests: `CompletionHoldTest`, `CompletionHoldViewModelsTest`.

## Privacy and security

- Release builds log no requests and no debug output: `BuildInfo.isDebug` (set from `BuildConfig.DEBUG`) gates Ktor logging and the auth log file, and R8 strips `Log.v/d/i` and `Logger.d/i`.
- Backups and device transfer exclude the database, tokens, keysets, the AI keys, settings and conversations, alarm and widget state, and the auth log (`backup_rules.xml`, `data_extraction_rules.xml`, database name `vicu_database`).
- Cleartext http is allowed because self-hosted servers often run on a LAN; the setup screen warns when an http address points outside the local network.

## Testing

All of these are plain JVM tests (no device):

- `shared/src/commonTest` - repositories and the sync engine against in-memory fakes (`FakeTaskDao`, `FakeTaskServer`, Ktor `MockEngine`), ViewModels with `FakeRepositories`, the contract fixtures, the quick-add corpus, date and routine logic. Test doubles for time (`TestTimeSources`) and preferences (`InMemoryPreferencesDataStore`) live there.
- `shared/src/androidHostTest` - SQL and migrations run in sqlite-jdbc from the exported schemas.
- `app/src/test` - the Koin graph, schedulers, widget state, notification helpers.
- `app/src/androidTest` - instrumented UI tests; they need a device and are not part of the gate.
- `shared/src/iosTest` - Kotlin/Native tests on the iOS simulator (`:shared:iosSimulatorArm64Test`, which also runs `commonTest`). `IosKoinGraphTest` builds every definition of `sharedModules + iosModule` with an in-memory Room database, as `KoinGraphTest` does for Android: run it after any iOS DI change.

The design-token tests (`DesignTokensTest`, `AndroidContrastTest`, `HarmonizeVectorsTest`, ...) and `SharedContractIdentityTest` are described under "Design system, theme and motion".

Android classes are stubbed in JVM tests with `isReturnDefaultValues = true`. Coroutine tests use `kotlinx-coroutines-test` (`runTest`, virtual time).

## UI verification harness and device safety

**Device commands go only to the emulator `emulator-5554`, never to a physical phone** (a wireless phone is often connected). Use `adb -s emulator-5554 ...` and `ANDROID_SERIAL=emulator-5554 ./gradlew installDebug`; never a bare `adb`, `-d`, `-e`, `adb connect` or `adb devices` to pick a target. The harness enforces this: `scripts/ui-verify/droid.mjs` passes `-s emulator-5554` on every call, rejects the flags that pick another device, and aborts on import unless `emulator-5554` is up.

`scripts/ui-verify/` is a small Node tool (its own `package.json`, dependency `pngjs` for cropping; run `npm install` there once; not part of the Gradle build or the gate). `out/` and `node_modules/` are git-ignored. It drives the debug app (`com.rendyhd.vicu.debug`) over adb with real taps, swipes and key events:

- `shots.mjs`: captures by scenario (ids `a1` to `a12` follow the design-review plan, `baseline` is the default). `node shots.mjs --scenario baseline --theme light|dark|both`; `--wave N` (every scenario of that wave); `--list`; `--run NAME` (write to `out/NAME-<scenario>/` so `out/baseline` stays intact); `--token <path>` (the a10 first-run scenario signs in again); `--query <text>` (search step). Captures land in `out/<scenario>/<theme>-<step>.png`. A step that cannot run prints FAIL and the run exits 1, WARN lines are expectations the app does not meet yet and never fail the run, stub scenarios print STUB and pass. It restores night mode, font scale and animator scale when it ends; motion captures slow the animator scale and put it back to 1.
- `collab.mjs`: the collaboration checks on the seeded shared project (row signals, the Comments screen and a posted mention, editor chips, Assign sheet, Shared with, a private project unchanged), with the `a11y.mjs` rules on each screen; exit 1 when a check fails. It posts a comment to the shared server.
- `collab-lists.mjs`: a custom list with Assigned "To me" and then "To someone else" on the seeded shared project, and the `a11y.mjs` rules on the editor; it deletes the list at the end.
- `a11y.mjs`: accessibility report from a UI dump (rules `unnamed-clickable`, `checkbox`, `small-target` under 48 dp). `node a11y.mjs --screens today,editor` (screen names: `SCREENS` in `nav.mjs`), `--strict` exits 1 on any finding. Findings are also written to `out/a11y/<screen>.json`.
- `login.mjs` signs the debug app in with an API token (`--server`, default `http://10.0.2.2:3456`; `--inbox`; `--force` runs `pm clear` on the debug app first); `nav.mjs` has the navigation helpers; `droid.mjs` the adb driver. The token is read from the desktop repo's `scripts/ui-verify/.local` (default `../vicu/scripts/ui-verify/.local`), typed through adb and never printed.
- The data is the desktop harness' seeded Docker Vikunja (`node scripts/ui-verify/seed.mjs` in the `vicu` repo; the emulator reaches it at `10.0.2.2:3456`). Both harnesses share that server and its dataset, so do not run them at the same time. Install the build first: `ANDROID_SERIAL=emulator-5554 ./gradlew installDebug`.

## CI / Releases

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `./gradlew test lint assembleDebug :shared:compileCommonMainKotlinMetadata` on every push and pull request (JDK 17, Gradle cache).
- `.github/workflows/ios.yml` runs the iOS gate on `main`, and by hand (workflow_dispatch) archives the app and uploads it to TestFlight with an App Store Connect API key (secrets `ASC_KEY_ID`, `ASC_ISSUER_ID`, `ASC_KEY_P8`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`). GitHub's standard macOS runner has too little memory for that archive (gotcha 21), so builds go to TestFlight from a Mac with `iosApp/scripts/testflight.sh` (the Xcode account or an API key; `docs/ios.md`, Release).
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds a **signed release APK and AAB** when a GitHub release is published, with the repository secrets `KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `KEY_ALIAS`, `KEY_PASSWORD` and `STORE_PASSWORD`, attaches both, and uploads the AAB to **Google Play** (`com.rendyhd.vicu`) with the service account in `PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` (`github-play-publisher@vicu-play-publishing.iam.gserviceaccount.com`). The repository variable `PLAY_TRACK` picks the track (`alpha`, the closed test) and `PLAY_RELEASE_STATUS` the status (default `draft`; `completed` rolls out without the Play Console). The GitHub APK and Play use the same signing key (Play App Signing was set up with the release key), so installs from either update each other; the package and key are registered for Android developer verification.
- `adi-registration.yml` (Android developer verification APK) and `play-signing-key.yml` (the release key exported for Play App Signing) are one-off manual workflows; the listing texts, images and app content answers for Play are in `docs/store/google-play/`, the privacy policy in `docs/privacy-policy.md`.
- **When creating a release**: bump `versionCode` and `versionName` in `version.properties` (both apps read it), write the notes in `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md`, then `gh release create <tag> --title "..." --notes-file docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md` **without attaching a local APK**. CI builds and uploads the signed APK. Never attach a debug APK manually.

## Platforms

Android 8.0+ (minSdk 26, compile and target SDK 36). iOS 17+ on iPhone and iPad (`iosArm64`, `iosSimulatorArm64`); see "iOS" and `docs/ios.md`.

## iOS

`docs/ios.md` is the full description (build, simulator testing, architecture, App Group layout, differences from Android, release). The essentials:

- **Swift is thin.** `iosApp/Vicu` starts the shared code (`IosApp.start(widgetBridge:)` in the app delegate, before the first scene), forwards the scene phase (`onActive`, `onBackground`, `saveUiState`) and links (`openUrl`), and hosts `MainViewController`. Swift-only APIs reach Kotlin through small interfaces Swift implements (`AppleWidgetBridge` for WidgetKit).
- **Seams**: the same platform interfaces as Android, implemented in `iosMain` (`IosRepositoryHooks`, `IosSettingsHooks`, `IosAuthHooks`, `IosPlatformFiles`, `IosNetworkMonitor`, `IosKeychainTokenStorage`, `IosNotificationPermissionPlatform`), bound in `iosModule` (`di/KoinHelper.kt`). Where the platforms differ in kind, the rule moved to `commonMain` with tests and each platform applies it: `LocalNotificationPlanner` and `NotificationBudget` (iOS plans its at most 64 notifications ahead, since no code runs when one fires), `RoutineAlarmPlanner`, `NotificationActions`, `TokenRefreshRun`, `TaskWidgetStates`, `SyncRequester`.
- **Extensions are Swift only** and link no Kotlin. They exchange JSON files with the app through the App Group (`widgets/`, `share-inbox/`); the app does all the work (snapshots with phrased dates and colours, storing widget taps and shares, syncing). The database and preferences stay in Application Support, never in the App Group.
- **Background**: BGTaskScheduler refresh (`com.rendyhd.vicu.refresh`) and queue sync (`com.rendyhd.vicu.sync`); `SyncRequester` while the app runs. The simulator does not run BGTaskScheduler; Settings > General > Background activity shows the runs on a device.
- **Saved UI state** survives iOS ending the app through `UiStateCodec` and SwiftUI scene storage; a new type kept in `rememberSaveable` needs a codec entry or it is dropped (logged).
- **Configurations**: Debug, Release and Profile. Profile is Debug's identity (Vicu Debug) with optimized Swift and Kotlin (`KOTLIN_FRAMEWORK_BUILD_TYPE` in `Profile.xcconfig`, because the Kotlin plugin maps only the names Debug and Release): use it to judge speed on a device, where Debug's unoptimized Kotlin scrolls noticeably slower.
- **Device safety**: iOS tooling only drives simulators, picked by name or UDID (`scripts/ui-verify-ios/sim.mjs` refuses anything else). A physical iPhone is reached only through TestFlight or an Xcode run the user starts. TestFlight uploads, signing with the user's account and App Store submission are the user's.

## Key Gotchas

1. **Merge patches**: send only changed fields; a whole-object update zeroes fields you did not mean to touch.
2. **Null date** is `0001-01-01T00:00:00Z`; clearing a due date is `"due_date": null`.
3. **Glance is not Compose**: different imports and a different layout system.
4. **KSP version must match the Kotlin version line**; Room's schema location is a KSP argument, not the Room Gradle plugin.
5. **`SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`**: check and prompt on Android 12+/14+.
6. **Password login 412**: TOTP required; a 403 is wrong credentials.
7. **Position reorder** needs the project's list view id from the views endpoint.
8. **Subtasks** are task relations, not a separate model.
9. **AlarmManager is cleared on reboot**: `BootReceiver` and the periodic sync re-schedule.
10. **Never read the clock directly** in testable logic: use `TimeSource` and `DayClock`.
11. **New constructor parameter means a Koin edit**: run `KoinGraphTest`.
12. **`./gradlew test` covers `:shared` through its own `test` task** (an alias of `testAndroidHostTest`, because the Kotlin Multiplatform library plugin has none).
13. **Line endings**: several files are CRLF or mixed. Edit them in place without converting whole files, and write new files with LF.
14. **Device commands go only to `emulator-5554`** (`adb -s emulator-5554`, `ANDROID_SERIAL=emulator-5554`); never to a physical phone.
15. **`VicuMotion` is not a `MotionScheme`** and is not passed to `MaterialTheme`; read it directly and give every animation a reduced variant.
16. **No hard-coded colours or date strings in screens**: colours come from the theme and `LocalVicuColors`, date text from `DateDisplay`.
17. **commonMain is not Android**: no `android.*`, `java.*`, `String.format` or `Dispatchers.IO` there (`AppDispatchers.io`); `:shared:compileCommonMainKotlinMetadata` catches it.
18. **Kotlin/Native and Objective-C**: a Kotlin class that subclasses an Objective-C class (a UIKit delegate) cannot have a companion object with fields and cannot be declared in Koin; build it by hand and hold a strong reference (UIKit delegates are weak).
19. **Nothing touches `UNUserNotificationCenter` or other app-only services while Koin builds a definition**: `IosKoinGraphTest` runs without an app bundle and crashes on it. Read them in `start()` or on first use.
20. **Widgets in the simulator need a team-signed build** (`iosApp/scripts/sign-for-simulator.sh`); an ad-hoc build cannot resolve the widget's App Intents entity and always shows Today.
21. **The Release iOS framework link runs the Kotlin/Native compiler out of process** (`kotlin.native.disableCompilerDaemon=true`, `kotlin.native.jvmArgs=-Xmx10g` in `gradle.properties`; its live heap peaks near 7.6 GB and it takes about 10 minutes; 6 GB runs out). Keep `org.gradle.jvmargs` at 2 GB. GitHub's standard macOS runner (7 GB) is too small for it.
22. **No Material `DatePicker`**: it starts the week where the device's region does (on iOS it reads only `NSCalendar.currentCalendar`, ignoring any locale passed in), and Vicu's weeks start on Monday. Use `MonthCalendar`.
23. **A `CLMonitor` name is letters and digits only**: iOS 26.5 throws an uncaught exception at `CLMonitor(name)` for a hyphen or any other character, so the app ends at launch. Renaming the monitor orphans the regions watched under the old name.
24. **The native speech library is always built optimized** (`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`, also for the debug app) for arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a and x86_64 only; arm64 is built for ARMv8.2 with dot product and half precision (`GGML_CPU_ARM_ARCH` in `native/speech/CMakeLists.txt`; the ARMv8.0 baseline left Whisper large-v3-turbo unable to finish a phrase on a Pixel 10 Pro), and `AndroidSpeechEngineNative` does not load it on a processor whose `/proc/cpuinfo` lacks `asimddp` or `asimdhp`; those `abiFilters` sit in `externalNativeBuild.cmake`, so they limit what CMake builds, not what is packaged (the other libraries' x86 copies stay, and on x86 `AndroidSpeechEngineNative.isLoaded` is false). The first `assembleDebug` builds whisper.cpp three times; `.cxx/` keeps it afterwards. CMake 3.22.1 fetches whisper.cpp from GitHub, so a clean native build needs the network. The JNI names follow `com.rendyhd.vicu.speech.VicuSpeechJni` (kept in `proguard-rules.pro`): renaming the class or a method means renaming the C function too.
25. **iOS links the speech library twice over**: cinterop carries `libvicu_speech_all.a` in the klib, but the static framework does not apply the def's `linkerOpts`, so `project.yml` links Metal, MetalKit, Accelerate and libc++ for the app. Close every model and detector handle you open before a test or process ends; ggml's Metal teardown asserts on open ones.
