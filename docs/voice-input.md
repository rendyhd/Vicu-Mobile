# Adding tasks by voice

What Vicu offers for adding a task by voice on each platform, how it works, and the options left
for later. The text is read like quick add in every case (`TaskParser`, the same rules as the
desktop): "Call mom tomorrow 3pm #Family @phone" is a task "Call mom" due tomorrow at 15:00 in the
Family project with the label phone.

## How it works

`TextTaskCreator` (`shared/.../util/`) turns one sentence into a task without a screen: the parser
with the user's quick-add settings, the same field rules as the quick add sheet with nothing picked
by hand (`resolveEntryFields`), labels matched by name or created, the default reminder for a due
date, the project the text names or else the Inbox. The task is stored on the device and queued
(`TaskRepository.createQueued`), so the answer comes at once and nothing is lost offline; the sync
sends it. It answers with a confirmation such as `Added “Call mom”, tomorrow, 15:00`.

A place phrase for a saved place sets the task's location reminder (`PlacePhrases`, English): "when
I get home", "when I'm at work", "when I arrive at Mom's" (arrive) or "when I leave work", "when I'm
leaving home" (leave), anywhere in the sentence ("When I get home, call mom", "Call mom when I get
home tomorrow"); the bare "leaving home" and "arriving at work" only at its start or end, where they
cannot be part of the task. "the" or "my" before the place is fine. The quick add on both apps reads the same
phrases as you type (the parser's `TokenType.PLACE`, given the saved places): section 5.3 of the
cross-app contract, with the place cases of `nlp-corpus-v1.json`. The phrase is taken out of the title, and the reply says it:
`Added “Call mom”, when you arrive at Home`, plus a note when location access is not set to Always.
A place that is not saved ("when I get to the supermarket") stays in the title and sets nothing.

Siri itself sends "remind me ..." without an app name to Apple Reminders; iOS has no default app
setting for reminders, so the user names Vicu ("Remind me in Vicu", then "call mom when I get
home").

## In the app: hold +

Holding the + button (`AppFab`) for 400 ms listens in the app, on both platforms. A card over the
screen shows the words as they are recognized, with the parsed parts in the quick add colours and
the fields as pills under them (`voicePreview`, the same reading as `TextTaskCreator`). Letting go
adds the task through `TextTaskCreator` and says what was added on the app snackbar, with Undo
(which deletes the task). The task goes to the list the + was held in, as that list's quick add
would put it (`TaskDefaults`, handed over by the screen's `ScreenFab`): a project screen's project,
the Inbox, a custom list's "add to" project, today's date on Today; Upcoming, Anytime and a tag add
to the Inbox, undated (their names still go to the assistant as the list you are in). A project or date in the words wins. The list's project and date show as
pills before anything is said. Routines' + adds a routine, so holding it does not listen.

Sliding the finger down by more than 56 dp arms the cancel ("Let go to cancel"); letting go there
adds nothing. With smart dictation ready, sliding up by more than 72 dp locks it (the assistant's sparkle
above an arrow on the card shows where): smart dictation takes over and keeps listening (see "With the
assistant"); the card goes, and the words said so far become its first. A pause while still holding does not end the task:
Android's recognizer ends an utterance at a pause, and the next one is joined to it. After the
finger lifts the app waits up to 1.5 s for the recognizer's last words, then adds what it has.

A quick tap still opens quick add. Moving the + before the hold time drags it instead, on screens
whose headers take it (`fabDropTarget`): Upcoming's days and their project groups, Today's header
and project groups (an Overdue group takes the project only), Anytime's projects and a project's
subprojects. The headers outline while the + is dragged and fill under it; letting go on one opens
quick add with that day and project, anywhere else does nothing. On other screens a move is left
to the button, as before.

After the fifth task added through the + button's quick add, a hint above the button says "Hold +
to say a task", once (`FabHint`, `FabHintStore`); not at all once a task was added by voice.

A screen reader keeps the tap and gets "Say a task" as a custom action: the card listens without a
hold and has Done (or Add) and Cancel, and Keep talking when smart dictation is ready (the lock);
back closes it. Dragging only saves taps, so it has no
action. With reduced motion (Android animations off, iOS Reduce Motion) the card and hint only
fade, and the microphone's ring brightens with the voice instead of growing.

| | Android | iOS |
|---|---|---|
| Recognizer | `SpeechRecognizer` (the device's, usually the Google app), `AndroidSpeechInput` | `SFSpeechRecognizer` and `AVAudioEngine`, `SpeechRecognizerBridge.swift` behind `AppleSpeechBridge` |
| Permission | `RECORD_AUDIO`, asked on the first hold, never at start | Speech recognition, then the microphone, on the first hold |
| Refused | The system speech screen (`VoiceAddActivity`, no permission needed) | A message with Settings |
| No recognizer | The system speech screen, else quick add | Quick add |

The pieces: `SpeechInput` (the platform seam), `HoldToTalk` (the session: listening, joining
utterances, release, cancel, the message), `FabGesture` (tap, hold and drag told apart by time and
distance, without Compose), `FabController` and `fabGestures` (the + button's pointer handling, in
the initial pass so a tap reaches the button untouched), `FabDropTargets` (the headers and the hit
test), `FabOverlays` (the card, the dragged +, the hint). Tests: `FabGestureTest`,
`FabDropTargetsTest`, `FabHintTest`, `HoldToTalkTest`, `VoicePreviewTest`.

A place phrase works here too: "call mom when I get home" sets the location reminder, as above.

## iOS

- **Siri**: "Add a task in Vicu" (also "New Vicu task", "Add to Vicu", "Remind me in Vicu").
  Siri asks "What's the task?", the user says it, and Siri reads back what was added. Two turns:
  App Shortcut phrases cannot carry free text, so the task cannot be part of the first sentence.
  `AddTaskIntent` (`iosApp/Vicu/`) runs in the app's process without opening it
  (`openAppWhenRun = false`) and is allowed on a locked phone (`.alwaysAllowed`: it adds and
  reads nothing back), so it works hands-free and in CarPlay.
- **Shortcuts and the Action Button**: "Dictate Text" followed by Vicu's "Add a task" with the
  dictated text as its Task adds in one step.
- **In the app**: hold + (above), or the keyboard's microphone in quick add.

## Android

- **Quick add widget** (2x1): the mic opens the system speech screen ("What's the task?") over the
  home screen, adds the task without opening the app and shows the confirmation as a toast; + opens
  quick add. The Tasks widget has the same mic next to its +.
- **App icon shortcuts** (long-press): "Add task" (quick add) and "Add by voice".
- **In the app**: hold + (above), or the keyboard's microphone in quick add.
- `VoiceAddActivity` uses `RecognizerIntent`, the system's speech screen, so it needs no
  microphone permission (only holding + does). Without a speech service it opens quick add instead.

## With the assistant

Holding + and letting go is always quick capture, the path above, with no model: fast, one task.
With smart dictation on (Settings, Assistant; `docs/ai-assistant-v1.md`, sections 3.7 and 4),
sliding up to the lock opens the draft sheet (`DictationSheet`: small at the bottom until there
are cards to check, then 80% of the screen, as Ask) with the microphone on
(`DictationMic`): each pause sends what was said to the user's own model, the first time as a
dictation and after that as an edit of the drafts, so the cards appear and change while the
person keeps talking ("and call mum tomorrow", "make the first one Friday"). Talking again while
the model works cancels that request; its words go out with the next ones. The microphone button
on the sheet turns it off and on; Add adds the drafts, checked against the same parser and fields
as quick add. When the model cannot be reached the words wait on the card with Retry and Add as
one task, which is the path above. Settings, Assistant has Try it, which opens the same sheet.

The sheet's **Brain dump** switch (section 4.8; a note under it says what it does, and the app
remembers it) changes what a pause does: nothing is sent, the words are added to the dump, which
the person can also type into, and the microphone waits `dump_idle_s` (5 minutes) of quiet before
it turns off. Organize sends the whole dump once; the answer can add new projects and subprojects,
and the plan lists the tasks under their projects. What is said or typed after that waits for
Update, and Add creates the new projects (this needs a connection) before the tasks.

With a speech model, recording starts at once while the model loads (seconds the first time; the
phrases wait for it), and after the finger lifts the card shows "Turning your words into text…" with
Cancel while the last phrases are transcribed. The debug app logs how long the model took to load
and each phrase took (`LocalSpeech`), to judge a model on a phone.

The open microphone (`OpenMic`, from `SelectingSpeechInput.openMic`) ends a turn at a pause of
`speech.turn.end_of_turn_ms` (1 s) and turns itself off after `idle_s` (60 s) without speech, or
when the app goes to the background. With a speech model chosen (Whisper or Parakeet through
whisper.cpp) the words are recognised on the phone and the voice detector finds the pauses
(`LocalSpeechSession` with its events, `TurnWatch`, `LocalTurns`); otherwise the system
recognizer listens an utterance at a time, and words that stop changing for 1 s end it
(`PlatformOpenMic`). `TurnSender` decides what goes out and when talking cancels a request.
Tests: `OpenMicTest`, `TurnWatchTest`.

## For later

- **One sentence on iOS (Siri AI)**: iOS 27 has an App Schema domain for reminders
  (`.reminders`, `createReminder` with a title, due date, list and tags). Adopting it lets
  "Add call mom tomorrow to Vicu" work in one sentence where Siri AI is available: iPhone 15 Pro
  or newer, English first, not in the EU on iOS at launch (September 2026). It needs Xcode 27 and
  an `@available(iOS 27, *)` intent beside `AddTaskIntent`, which stays for everyone else.
- **Gemini on Android**: Google Assistant's App Actions are gone from phones and Gemini does not
  run them. Gemini reaches third-party apps through AppFunctions (`androidx.appfunctions`,
  Android 16 and later), still a private preview for trusted testers in mid 2026. An `addTask`
  AppFunction would call `TextTaskCreator`; it is worth building once Google opens the program.
  Android Auto has no category for task apps, so there is no in-car voice path on Android today.
- **Parsing spoken text**: dictation writes "3 p.m.", "3 PM" or "hashtag errands" where typing
  gives "3pm" and "#errands". The parser and the NLP corpus are shared with the desktop
  (`test-fixtures/nlp-corpus-v1.json`), so spoken forms go in the corpus first, in both repos.
