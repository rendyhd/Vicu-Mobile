 * - The screen being left keeps its state when it is a smart list or Settings ([leavingKeepsState]),
 *   wherever the move goes, so coming back to it shows its content in the first frame. It used to
 *   follow the destination: going to the Inbox or to a project threw Today away, and the next visit
 *   built it again from an empty list while it faded in (the cross-fade froze when the rows came).
 * - Smart lists and Settings are restored and reuse their entry.
 * - The Inbox is the root: re-created rather than restored, so re-opening it replays its loading
 *   state once instead of showing a stale saved one (issue #6).
 * - Projects, tags and custom lists share one destination type across different arguments, so
 *   they never reuse an entry or a saved state: each gets its own view model, and leaving one
 *   saves nothing (a saved state of theirs would never be restored).
