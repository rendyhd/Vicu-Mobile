/**
 * The only place that clears local data, so every screen that does it keeps the same promise:
 * work that has not reached the server survives unless the user explicitly discards it or the
 * account it belongs to is gone.
 *
 *  - [clearCaches]: a "clear cache and re-sync". Tasks, projects, labels and attachments are
 *    rebuilt from the server. The offline queue, the rows the queue refers to, and routine
 *    history that is still waiting to be uploaded stay.
 *  - [discardUnsyncedAndClearCaches]: the same, after the user chose to drop the offline queue.
 *  - [wipeEverything]: sign-out, or a different account signed in. Also forgets the preferences
 *    that are keyed by the old account's ids (collapsed sections, label order, routine and
 *    widget settings), the synced settings' local copy and the location reminders, stops the
 *    account's background work and drops shares not added yet.
 *
 * Every operation waits for a running sync to finish and blocks new ones while it works, so a
 * sync cannot write the old account's data back right after the wipe.
